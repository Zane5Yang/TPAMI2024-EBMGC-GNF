# EBMGC-GNF: Efficient Balanced Multi-view Graph Clustering via Good Neighbor Fusion

![Framework](imgs/framework.png)

This is the official implementation of our TPAMI-2024 paper _EBMGC-GNF: Efficient Balanced Multi-view Graph Clustering via Good Neighbor Fusion_.

Run `EBMGC_GNF_demo.m` to reproduce our results.

The source code in `finchpp` folder is based on https://github.com/ssarfraz/FINCH-Clustering and slightly modified to fulfill our needs.

If you use our code, please cite our work as:
